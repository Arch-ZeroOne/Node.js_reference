# 🛡️ Node.js + Firebase Security Roadmap with Mini Projects

This roadmap helps you learn **Node.js** and **Firebase Authentication security** by building real mini-projects. By the end, you'll understand how to assign roles, verify users, and secure APIs with Firebase Admin SDK.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Use Node.js + Firebase to:

- 🔐 Handle login and registration securely
- 👥 Assign roles like "admin" or "customer"
- 🛡️ Build protected APIs based on user roles
- ✅ Use Firebase Admin SDK to verify tokens and manage users

---

## 🧭 Roadmap Overview

---

### 📦 Phase 1: Core Node.js (Basics)

> Learn basic Node.js and JavaScript patterns

#### ✅ Concepts

- Node.js environment and `npm`
- `require()` and module exports
- `async/await`, Promises
- File system basics

#### 🛠️ Mini Project 1: CLI Task Manager

- Add, delete, and list tasks from a JSON file
- Use `fs` and `readline`
- Practice `async/await` with file operations

---

### 🧩 Phase 2: Express.js API Server

> Build your first backend server with routes

#### ✅ Concepts

- Install Express.js
- REST API: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`
- Route grouping with `Router()`
- Handling JSON bodies

#### 🛠️ Mini Project 2: Notes REST API

- Create a REST API to manage notes (CRUD)
- Each note has a title and content
- Store notes in memory or a JSON file

---

### 🔐 Phase 3: Firebase Admin SDK Integration

> Connect Firebase Admin SDK for secure user management

#### ✅ Concepts

- Load Firebase service account
- `admin.auth().getUser(uid)`
- `setCustomUserClaims()` to assign roles
- `verifyIdToken()` to decode tokens securely

#### 🛠️ Mini Project 3: Firebase Role Manager API

- Admin-only route to assign roles to users
- Use Firebase Admin SDK to manage roles
- Build `/set-role` and `/get-user` endpoints

---

### 🛡️ Phase 4: Token Verification + Role-Based Access

> Secure routes using Firebase tokens and custom claims

#### ✅ Concepts

- Frontend gets Firebase ID token after login
- Backend verifies ID token using Admin SDK
- Middleware for role-based access (`isAdmin`, `isCustomer`)
- Secure routes based on role

#### 🛠️ Mini Project 4: Auth-Protected API

- Express backend with `/admin-only`, `/customer-only`, and `/public`
- Middleware checks Firebase ID token
- Access control based on user role

---

## 🧪 Bonus Projects

### 🔐 Firebase Auth Dashboard (Fullstack)

- Firebase Auth login page (React or plain HTML)
- Node.js backend with Admin SDK
- Show user info and role after login
- Show or hide buttons depending on role

### 🧰 Firebase File Upload API

- Secure upload route that only allows authenticated users
- Store file in Firebase Storage (optional)

---

## 🛠️ Tools You’ll Use

| Tool/Library       | Purpose                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Node.js            | Backend runtime             |
| Express.js         | REST API framework          |
| Firebase Admin SDK | Manage users, roles, tokens |
| dotenv             | Load secrets and config     |
| Firebase JS SDK    | Client-side auth            |
| Postman            | API testing                 |

---

## 🧠 Tips

- Always validate tokens on the backend
- Don’t trust `role` from Firestore directly — use custom claims
- Use environment variables (`.env`) to protect secret keys
